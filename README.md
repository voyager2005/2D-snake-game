### Things that I want to do next :
- [x] Display The Co-ordinate of the snake's head and the position of the food 
- [x] Add different shapes and colours of food which are picked randomly
- [ ] Make the game spawn more than 1 food at a time
- [ ] Have certain number of hearts/lives
- [ ] Add power-ups
