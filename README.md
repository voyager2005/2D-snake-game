## Controls for the game:
These are the two controls that are accepted. In case you want any alternate controls you can add [this] code on [line 129]
<br />• 1st method:
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   w - up
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   a - left
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   s - down
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   d - right
<br />
<br />• 2nd method:
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ↑ arrow key - up
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ↓ arrow key - down
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   → arrow key - right
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ← arrow key - left


### Things that I want to do next :
- [x] Display The Co-ordinate of the snake's head and the position of the food 
- [x] Add different shapes and colours of food which are picked randomly
- [ ] Make the game spawn more than 1 food at a time
- [ ] Have certain number of hearts/lives
- [ ] Add power-ups
